These tend to be mild but talk to your doctor if they bother you or do not go away. The risk of side effects may increase the longer you take this medicine. You may be more likely to have a broken bone if you take it for a long time. It is best to avoid foods that seem to make your symptoms worse, such as rich, spicy, and fatty foods. Cutting down on caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee, and cola, as well as alcohol may also help.This medicine is not suitable for some people. Before taking this medicine, you need to tell your doctor if you have severe liver problems, are taking medicines for HIV, have had an allergic reaction to similar medicines in the past, or have osteoporosis.
